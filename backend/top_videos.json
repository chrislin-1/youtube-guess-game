His mom wasnt able to go becasue of work. I taped some of the morning before the surgery to show her and was already planning to tape afterwards. He had just had a tooth removed due to Hyperdontia or extra tooth. This was taken in the parking lot of the dentist office. He was so out of it. The staff was even laughing. This lasted for a few hours and he was fine. He even laughed at the video that night.\n\nHe is very smart and always has something interesting to say about many different issues. His philosophical reaction to the medication didnt really suprise us.\n\nDavid is a very good kid and I am blessed to have he and his brother William as sons.\n\nThis has been a great experience for our family.

If you enjoyed it, share it with someone else you think may enjoy it, too! Ratings and favorites are also extremely helpful in spreading the video around :) Subscribe if you're interested in more!\n\nLyrics:\nI came to dig\nI'll build a city oh so big\nJust wait a sec gotta kill this pig\nCook me some bacon take a swig swig swig\n\nBecause there must be something I can craft\nTo help me ease the burden of this task\n\nI shoot my arrows in the air sometimes\nSinging ooooh\nCreeper's KO'd\nLoot his remains and now his sulfur's mine\nSinging ooooh\nNot today no\n\nThen I'll go to work under the birch tree\nAnd I'll make myself tons of TNT\nAnd I'll use it all to build a city\nI'll mine it all with TNT\n\nI came to blow\nUp everything you've ever known\nExpel you out of house and home\nBiome to biome you shall roam roam roam roam\n\nBecause I am a creeper I will rob\nAll of your precious items that's my job\n\nI shoot my arrows in the air sometimes\nSinging ooooh\nCreeper's KO'd\nT-bag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine\nSinging ooooh\nNot today no\n\nThen I'll get back home where I'll smile with glee\nNow that I can make tons of TNT\n'Cause I rule my world made in 3x3\nI'll blow it up with TNT\n\nGonna blow it all up\nEvery mountain every valley\nRuler of the world yup\nAll the animals will fear me\n'Cause TNT is just\nTNT's just really cool\nIs just really cool\nIs just really cool\n\nI shoot my arrows in the air sometimes\n\nI shoot my arrows in the air sometimes\nSinging ooooh\nCreeper's KO'd\nT-bag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine\nSinging ooooh\nNot today no\n\nThen I'll get back home where I'll smile with glee\nNow that I can make tons of TNT\n'Cause I rule my world made in 3x3\nI'll blow it up with TNT"

      "description": "Watch Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals play \"Come Down\", \"Heart Don't Stand A Chance\", \"Put Me Thru\" and \"Suede\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk Concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube? Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\n\nFollow NPR Music:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nAugust 15, 2016 by BOBBY CARTER • Good luck trying to classify Anderson .Paak and his band The Free Nationals. Much of their sound is layered atop a soulful hip-hop foundation; from there, your safest bet is to call it a hodgepodge of genres in the best way possible. Guitarist Jose Rios and bassist Kelsey Gonzalez inject a hard-rock edge into the Hi-Tek-produced \"Come Down,\" this set's opening number. When you hear them play the first few jazz chords of \"Heart Don't Stand A Chance,\" it's hard to simply call this R&B.\n\nIt's been a slow build for .Paak, who released a few mixtapes before his 2014 debut album Venice. This year has marked his official breakout with Malibu, on which he did what so many in his position fail to do: He capitalized. After bursting into the spotlight with his appearances on Dr. Dre's Compton LP, he immediately prepped the release of Malibu. The album sculpted an entirely new lane for Anderson .Paak. He can rhyme with best of 'em, and his vocal styling, reminiscent of '70s and '80s greats, is invigorating when set against today's tender R&B elite. Before all that, he's a drummer-slash-bandleader.\n\nI've experienced three separate presentations of this band. First, there's the recorded version, on which .Paak collaborates with some of hip-hop's finest producers. Then, their tight stage show hits you in the chest with 90-plus minutes of pure energy. In the midst of a whirlwind tour, they stopped by the Tiny Desk and reworked three cuts from Malibu, along with an audience request that shocked even them. They stripped down and pulled back just enough to fill the room.\n\nMalibu is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/malibu/id1065681363?app=itunes&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Malibu-Anderson-Paak/dp/B0192ZU8TG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471013450&sr=8-1&keywords=Anderson+.Paak+malibu+Music\n\nSet List:\n\"Come Down\"\n\"Heart Don't Stand A Chance\"\n\"Put Me Thru\"\n\"Suede\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Niki Walker, Abby O'Neill; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Claire Hannah Collins, Nickolai Hammar; Production Assistant: Sophie Kemp; Photo: Cameron Robert/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video",

First, there's the recorded version, on which .Paak collaborates with some of hip-hop's finest producers. Then, their tight stage show hits you in the chest with 90-plus minutes of pure energy. In the midst of a whirlwind tour, they stopped by the Tiny Desk and reworked three cuts from Malibu, along with an audience request that shocked even them. They stripped down and pulled back just enough to fill the room.\n\nMalibu is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/malibu/id1065681363?app=itunes&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Malibu-Anderson-Paak/dp/B0192ZU8TG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471013450&sr=8-1&keywords=Anderson+.Paak+malibu+Music\n\nSet List:\n\"Come Down\"\n\"Heart Don't Stand A Chance\"\n\"Put Me Thru\"\n\"Suede\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Niki Walker, Abby O'Neill; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Claire Hannah Collins, Nickolai Hammar; Production Assistant: Sophie Kemp; Photo: Cameron Robert/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video"
